## 📌 Examples of Programs

Here are just a few examples of what’s inside:

| Language | Example Programs |
|----------|------------------|
| C++ | `sorting/bubble.cpp`, `array/setmatrixzero.cpp`, `graph/input2.cpp` |
| Java | `lab/Swap.java`, `lab/Exceptions1.java`, `programs/Input.java` |
| Python | `functions/string_reverse.py`, `functions/fibonacci.py` |
| C | `arrays/pointer_demo.c`, `linkedlist/singlylist.c` |
| Codeforces | `codeforces/q1.cpp`, `q2.cpp`, `a.exe` |

## 🚀 How to Use

This repo is for **personal reference** and learning:

- Browse folders by language or topic
- Run code in your local editor (VS Code, CLion, etc.)
- Compare logic across different languages

---

## ⚙️ Future Improvements

- [ ] Add `.gitignore` for `.class`, `.exe`, and other compiled files
- [ ] Create topic-wise folders (e.g., `recursion/`, `stack/`)
- [ ] Add progress tracker or solved count
- [ ] Optional: auto-testing with GitHub Actions

## ⭐ Final Note

This isn’t a project — it's a **live archive of my coding practice**.  
Think of it like my digital whiteboard that just happens to live on GitHub 😄
